"""Data structure models for biological alignments.

This module contains the classes that describe representations
of nucleic acid, protein, and codon alignments.

An Alignment is a list of sequences that have been aligned such that
characters in the same alignment column are evolutionary related to
each other. Similar to the Sequence object, an Alignment has a name
to identify the alignment, a sequence type to identify what king of
biological sequence is in the alignment, and optionally, a description
that contains related information regarding the alignment.

The sequences in the Alignment object are not added at the time of
creating the object. Instead, sequences are added one by one through a
method. When reading from a FASTA file, a helper function called
`fasta_to_alignment` can be used to create the Alignment object
and add in the sequences automatically.

        """Adds a single aligned sequence to the alignment.

        In this method, the sequence is a string and not yet wrapped
        as a Sequence object. For adding sequence objects, use the
        `add_sequence_obj` method instead.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str
            Name of the sequence. This corresponds to the text found in the
            identifier line of a FASTA-formatted file.
        sequence : str
            Biological sequence.
        seq_type: str
            Indicates whether the sequence is a nucleotide, protein
            (amino acid), or codon sequence.
        description : str, optional
            Description or other miscellenous information about the sequence.
            In the FASTA format, this is found in the identifier line, but is
            separated from the identifier by a whitespace.
