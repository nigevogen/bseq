"""Data structure models for biological sequences.

This module contains the classes that describe representations
of nucleic acid, protein, and codon sequences.

A sequence is a series of characters that represent a biological
sequence of bases or amino acids. The Sequence object is meant to
represent these biological molecules. A Sequence object has a name
to identify the sequence, the string representation of the sequence,
a sequence type to identify what king of biological sequence the
string sequence is representing, and optionally, a description that
contains related information regarding the sequence. However, the
Sequence object is not meant to be used directly. Instead, it is
encouraged to use the subclasses of Sequence: NuclSequence for
nucleotide sequences, ProtSequence for protein/amino acid sequences,
and CodonSequence for coding sequences.

    `len(s)` returns 10 instead of 30. Similarly, indexing is via codon and notby nucleotide position.
